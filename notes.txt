To get the youBot in Gazebo and be able to control it:
* roslaunch youbot_object_grasp test.launch
* roslaunch youbot_control youbot_control.launch (from ~/youbot_tools_ws)

To see the youBot in rviz and manipulate the joints:
* roslaunch youbot_description youbot_rviz.launch (from ~/catkin_ws)

Next Steps:
----------
- Test MoveIt code on the youBot
  * Put the MoveIt code on the youBot and make sure it can control the arm to the candle position, etc.
- Complete the set of pre-programmed arm angles
  * Need a starting position for above the block for grasping.

Questions:
---------
- Is there a way to use MoveIt to specify only a position and don't care about the orientation?
- Is there a way to use MoveIt to specify a particular position and a suggested orientation and allow it to give me the closest orientation even if it is far off?
  * I want to specify a definite position and then say that I would really like to have a particular orientation but even if it ends up being far off, oh well, just give me the closest orientation.
